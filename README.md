Direct Cinema Media Fabrics

Goal:
	To create a program that had both cinematic planning and interactive capability via the incorporation of Arduino sensors.

Products:
	Photo Pacman - Pacman that operates with the input from the light sensors.
	PhotoResister - Prototype, simulation of plants growing depending on light sensor input.
	Simple Maze - Visual side project, creates a random maze that contains at least one solution.
	Arduino Reading Strip - Technical side project, meant to be able to interact with all the basic Arduino sensors.
	Pacman - Recreated version of Pacman, Pacman grows in size & strength as food is optained.
